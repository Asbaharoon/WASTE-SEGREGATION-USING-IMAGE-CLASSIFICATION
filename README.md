# WASTE-SEGREGATION-USING-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
Every year tons of waste is produced by houses and industries and handling the waste for the individual gets a bit hectic as well as tedious because the waste is not segregated based on its nature. This app will help us in segregating the waste materials, also make the segregation of material little less time consuming. In the future this product can be scaled to a TWO classes (i.e. RECYCLABLE and ORGANIC) of segregation.
The future scope of the can be implemented using IoT also.
